    <h1>Promised</h1>
    <p>What are some reasons that Promises are beneficial?</p>
            1. They can help handle asynchronous operations better.
            2. They improve handling errors.
    
    <p>What four states do Promises have?</p>
            1. The promise can be <em>fulfilled</em> indicating the promise was succesful.
            2. It can be <em>rejected</em> meaning it failed to go through.
            3. It can still be <em>pending</em> so it has yet to be fulfilled or rejected.
            4. If the promise is <em>settled</em> it has ether been fulfilled or rejected.

    <p>The Parameters of Promises</p>
            1. A callback function is needed for the promise constructor.
            2. You need to reslove and reject in the callback function.
            3. It will resolve if preformed and will reject if it did not.
    <p>What does async do in Javascript?</p>
            1. it is a function that provides a returns a promise, and holds those non Promises as well. 
            2. Async is used inconjuction with Await. Await is a keyword that makes JavaScript wait before fullfilling that promise.
